# 👋 Hi, I'm Avik Dwivedi

I'm a student passionate about music, martial arts, basketball, and statistics. Welcome to my personal site where I share my projects, work, and personal growth journey.

## 👤 Who I Am

I'm currently a high schooler that plays for my high school team, why also being a classical singer. Recently started learning cs and getting into statistics.

## 🎯 What I’m Into

### 🎵 Hindustani Music  
I perform classical raags and enjoy listening to other popular Indian vocalists such as Pandit Venkatesh Kumar, especially performing raags like Miyan ki Malhar. Singing helps me stay connected to cultural roots and tradition.

### 🏀 Basketball & Analytics  
I love analyzing player stats, performance, and advanced metrics like net rating and true shooting %. I’m working on projects that combine AI and the NBA.

### 🥋 Martial Arts  
I practice martial arts for self-discipline, mental focus, confidence, and physical strength. It's a big part of my mindset and lifestyle.

### 💻 Technology & Learning  
I’m learning web development with Jekyll and GitHub Pages, and building this website is part of that journey. I also enjoy exploring how AI can be applied in sports.
